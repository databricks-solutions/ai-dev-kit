    prompt: How do I look up Databricks documentation for a specific feature?
  outputs:
    response: |
      Use the Databricks documentation index at `https://docs.databricks.com/llms.txt`.

      Fetch it with WebFetch, then search for relevant sections and links. The index is organized by category:
      - Data Engineering (Lakeflow, Spark, Delta Lake, pipelines)
      - SQL & Analytics (Warehouses, queries, dashboards)
      - AI/ML (MLflow, model serving, GenAI)
      - Governance (Unity Catalog, permissions, security)
      - Developer Tools (SDKs, CLI, APIs, Terraform)

    prompt: What is the role of the databricks-docs skill?
  outputs:
    response: |
      This is a reference skill, not an action skill. Use it to:
      - Look up documentation when other skills don't cover a topic
      - Get authoritative guidance on Databricks concepts and APIs
      - Find detailed information to inform how you use MCP tools
      - Discover features and capabilities

      Always prefer using MCP tools for actions and load specific skills for workflows.

- id: databricks-docs_complement_skills_003
  inputs:
    prompt: How do I use databricks-docs alongside other skills?
  outputs:
    response: |
      The docs skill complements other skills:

      1. Load the specific skill for workflow patterns (e.g., databricks-spark-declarative-pipelines)
      2. Use databricks-docs to fetch docs if you need clarification on specific features
      3. Use MCP tools to actually perform the action (e.g., create_or_update_pipeline)

      Example: User wants to create a Delta Live Tables pipeline
      - Load `databricks-spark-declarative-pipelines` for workflow patterns
      - Fetch docs via llms.txt if you need clarification on DLT features
      - Use `create_or_update_pipeline` MCP tool to create the pipeline
    execution_success: true
  expectations:
    expected_facts:
    - Load specific skills for workflows
    - Use docs for clarification
    - Use MCP tools for actions
